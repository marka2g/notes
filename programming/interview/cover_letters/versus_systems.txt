Battle Tested Dev

- EMPEX == inspiration


- took forcefield from subscription 0 to 18K+ users


- can't express how excited i am ; u guys are the only people advertising that you took the plunge and started to drink the elixir.

  if my recent life expirience was a pipe function, it would go something like this...

  if mark.cortizol_level > 100
    mark
    |> move(from: "venice", to: "koreatown")
    |>

  - most rails, maintaining a grape api(yuk).  then, things got more interesting... mdm -> needed to be rewritten and i suggested elixir.  turned out that our vanc dev loved elixir -> subsequently, i saw him popping up on the phoenix mailing lists along side jose' valim

the only downside, in an effort to reduce the daily dumping of cortizol, i decided to move from venice to korea town.  ...bummer, apple sherlocked us.
