Dear Output Team,
Uhm, whoa. I just spent waaaaaay too long on your website! Even if you guys don't knock on my door, I'm pretty sure that the builtinla.com job posting has just earned you guys a new customer. As to my excitement for Output, I'm lovin' your suite. The Analog Strings Expansion is killer, Arcade Patterns are sick but my favorite plugin so far is the Substance Bass Engine; now that's some sub, wow! #wantwantwant!
While reading through the job description, my curiosity peaked (more than once). For one, my skill set acutely matches your job description. I've been programming for close to 10 years and developing Rails apps and apis for a solid 6 years. As a team lead at my current job at Forcefield Inc., we made the decision to add Reactjs Native to our suite of applications to be able to support Android devices in addition to iOS. It's been a blast to work with Redux's strict data down, unidirectional flow pattern; so many pain points resolved!
Also, I consider myself a studio rat for life. Before becoming a programmer, I worked in the music industry in many capacities. It all started many years ago with a internship at Chicago Recording Company. A few years later, I started working with Curtis Jones (Cajmere/Green Velvet). I was his tour manager, label employee at Cajual/Relief Records and even at times, a session guitarist and bassist for him. After that, I opened a record store with two friends in Chicago called Wax Addict Records. Those were fun times!
Name dropping and reminiscing aside, I'm now a devoted programmer and currently enamored by the power of Elixir and the Erlang OTP (Open Telecom Platform). Don't get wrong, I love the warm waters of Ruby, but functional programming with the Erlang BEAM exponentially improves concurrency and fault tolerance. Plus, the budding community is helping to redefine the possibilities of distributed software. Two of my favorite Conference talks:
Collaborative Music with Elm and Phoenix - Josh Adams: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OTPTNJji1I&t=1708s
Mat Trudel: Recreating The "Amen Break" with Elixir: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XN4WuOujr38
