Hi Luis (Cruz | Recruiter),
I am, just extremely busy at my current job.  Basically, due to changes with Apple, I am looking for new opportunities starting from August 15. Currently, I mostly take care of the backend (Rails API).  I've also recently got into Elixir/Phoenix and would love to keep on that thread.  I'm so taken with Elixir and functional programming.
Here's my updated resume. http://marksadegi.com  I redid it with limited time so if you spot anything that needs updating, let me know!
Regards,
Mark



Hello Basil,
I apologize for the delay.  We have an extremely important demo tomorrow that I've been working feverishly toward.  I now see light at the end of the tunnel.  We can have a quick chat today if you're free.  Please let me know before you can so I can expect your call as my phone gets inundated with marketing calls.
Regards,
Mark

Hi Thibaud,
I would be up to chat.  Loomly looks like a service I would actually use :-)  Also, here's an updated resume.
http://marksadegi.com . Also, please reply with the number that you will call from; I get inundated with  marketing spam calls and rarely answer unrecognized calls.  Hope to talk to you soon,

Regards,
Mark

Hi Rob,
Thanks for getting back! I've been working feverishly over the weekend to wrap a few things before a major demo on Tuesday. I will schedule a meeting with you as soon as can. I anticipate my schedule to free up by tomorrow afternoon.  Will that work for you?
Regards,
Mark Sadegi

### honey
Hi Paulina, thanks for reaching out. I am currently looking for a new opportunity. To be candid, I did see your job posting on builtinla.com and was intrigued because I actually enjoy using the honey plugin from time-to-time. The reason I didn't engage is because the overall stack and languages that you guys work with are a bit different the current ones that I've been working with. Of coarse that's not a deal breaker but having most of my experience in languages like Ruby and most recently, Elixir/Erlang, I wasn't sure you guys would have a need for my skillset. I am always open to learn new languages and frameworks(its what we do as polyglots ;-) ) so I'll take a shot in the dark and submit an application through your /careers link.
Just for your records, here's my most current resume: http://marksadegi.com . Any advice on improvements are welcome as that was the quickest pass I could muster while currently working full time.
Regards,
Mark Sadegi


### https://www.therealreal.com/
Hi Tanya, thank you for your interest. The skillset you guys are looking for seem a perfect fit. Unfortunately, my fiancée has 8 more months of school in Los Angeles so I cannot make a move before then. After that, definitely, yes. Thanks, Mark

### enova
Hi Olivia, thank you for your interest. I am originally from Chicago and only a recent transplant to Los Angeles.  That said, I've been to a few Ruby/Js Meetups at Enova and am familiar with you guys. The skillset you guys are looking for seem to match up nicely. Unfortunately, my fiancée has 8 more months of school in Los Angeles so I cannot make a move before then. After that, definitely, I would be interested to exploring the possibility. Thanks, Mark

## Alexandra - fullstack in westlake

## random replies
Yes, tomorrow, say, sometime in the morning? If you can reply with a time, I'll make sure to answer.  I've been inundated by spam rob calls so it's rare that i pick up numbers that I don't recognize.
Here's buy cell.  I look forward to speaking with you.
