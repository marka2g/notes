Dear Swell Dev Team,

While reading through the job description, my curiosity peaked. For one, my skill set acutely matches your job description. I've been programming for close to 10 years and developing Rails apps and APIs for a solid 6 of those. I feel that my skill set and past experiences will successfully compliment the Full Stack Developer position at Swell.

As a team lead at my current job Forcefield Inc., we made the decision to add Reactjs Native to our suite of applications to be able to support Android devices in addition to our existing iOS suite. It's been a blast to work with Redux's strict data-down, unidirectional flow pattern; so many pain points resolved!

Also, at Forcefield Inc., we recently needed to improve a portion of our Rails stack to be more performant and fault tolerant. As a result, I've become enamored by the power of Elixir and the Erlang OTP (Open Telecom Platform). Don't get wrong, I love the warm waters of Ruby, but functional programming with the Erlang BEAM has exponentially improved our sudden need for concurrency.

At this point, you may be asking, 'what does this have to do with our stack' at Swell?  Allow me to submit the outlandish response of, 'maybe nothing, maybe everything.' As I gain more experience one fact stays consistent, technology evolves faster that our job titles. Adapting quickly is crucial and I'm sure that its no different at Swell.

Thanks for your time and consideration and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. For my most up-to-date résumé, please go to https://marksadegi.com.

Mark Sadegi
